# Data concentrator library in javascript

This is a small javascript lib/module, to read all dnodes in db, write a single dnode and read a single dnode. 
Check [data-concentrator](https://github.com/dcrntn/data-concentrator) software for more information.

## Note 
The tests are specific for each, because of the uid-s. And already made datanodes are needed.
